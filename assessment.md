## Background

As a full stack developer at Depop, one of the tasks you'll often be faced with is to bring a design to life, communicating with an API in order to surface the information used in the design, and providing the ability for user interaction.

With this exercise we are interested in seeing how you approach front end focused task.

## Exercise

The core of Depop's community are shop pages, where individuals list the items they have for sale. 

You can see an example here: https://www.depop.com/secondlifevintage/. 

This task is to create a basic shop page.

A simple design for this can be found here for guidance: <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XssSAHxZD2T66V0SxysKkkBSVqbGW5QX>

A static API for the product data is available at: <https://5c78274f6810ec00148d0ff1.mockapi.io/api/v1/products>

### Product Requirements

It's not important that you complete this set of requirements. We're more so interested in understanding you better, e.g. your approach, your reasoning and how you communicate.

- Display the list of products;
- Add a loading state
- Add functionality to show/hide sold items;
- Add functionality to like/unlike a product;
- Add a dropdown list showing the liked product as shown in the design

### Tips

- There are already some components for you to use 
- If you get stuck, vocalize your thought process

Good luck and enjoy!
