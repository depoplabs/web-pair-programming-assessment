## Background

As a full stack developer at Depop, one of the tasks you'll often be faced with is to bring a design to life, communicating with an API in order to surface the information used in the design, and providing the ability for user interaction.

With this exercise we are interested in seeing how you approach front end focused task. 

A few notes before you start:

- In a team communication is important and we like to share ideas, solutions and problems together!

## Exercise

The core of depop's community are shop pages, where individuals list the items they have for sale (you can see an example here: https://www.depop.com/secondlifevintage/). 

This task is to create a basic shop page. 

A simple design for this can be found here for guidance: <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XssSAHxZD2T66V0SxysKkkBSVqbGW5QX>

A static API for the product data is available at: <https://5c78274f6810ec00148d0ff1.mockapi.io/api/v1/products>

o A readme detailing how to run the project and any notes you'd like to leave is always appreciated
### Product Requirements

- Retrieve data from the given API endpoint;
- Display the list of products;
- Add functionality to like/unlike a product;
- Add functionality to show/hide sold items;
- Add a dropdown list showing the liked product as shown in the design

### Tips

- Consider what makes a good application that will go into production
- A tested component is a reliable component!

Good luck and enjoy!
